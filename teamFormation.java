To solve this problem, you can use a greedy approach. Here's a simple algorithm to find the maximum possible total number of colleagues:

1. Sort the array of colleague skills in ascending order.
2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the beginning of the array.
3. Iterate through the array, and for each colleague skill, try to include as many colleagues as possible in a team such that the difference between the highest and lowest skill levels is not greater than 5.
4. Move the pointers accordingly to include more colleagues in the team while maintaining the balance condition.
5. Repeat the process until all colleagues are included in teams or until the maximum number of teams is reached.

Here's a Java function that implements this algorithm:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumTeams {
    public static int maxTeams(int[] skills, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(skills); // Sort skills in ascending order
        int totalColleagues = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < skills.length; i++) {
            int j = i + 1; // Pointer to the next colleague
            int teamSize = 1; // Current team size

            while (j < skills.length && skills[j] - skills[i] <= 5 && teamSize < 5) {
                // Include colleagues in the team as long as the balance condition is met
                j++;
                teamSize++;
            }

            totalColleagues += teamSize;

            if (totalColleagues >= k * 5) {
                // Maximum number of teams reached
                break;
            }
        }

        return totalColleagues;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int[] skills = {1, 7, 3, 4, 9, 12, 2};
        int k = 2;

        int result = maxTeams(skills, k);
        System.out.println("Maximum total number of colleagues: " + result);
    }
}
```

You can customize the `skills` array and `k` variable in the `main` method to test different scenarios. The function `maxTeams` returns the maximum total number of colleagues that can be included in no more than `k` non-empty balanced teams.
